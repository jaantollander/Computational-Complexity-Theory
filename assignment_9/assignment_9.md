# H9.1
Let $ϕ$ be CNF formula with $m$ clauses. We can formulate a greedy algorithm for deterministic $2$-approximation for MAX SAT..

---

**Create sorted formula $ϕ'.$**

1) Count the amount of each literal in $ϕ.$
2) Sort literals in each clause from most frequent to the least frequent, that is, in decreasing order.
3) Lexicographically sort clauses in decreasing order.

**Greedily assign truth values to the variables**:

For all clauses in $ϕ'$ or until all variables have been assigned a truth value

1) If clause is *satisfied* or *unsatisfied* move to the next clause.
2) If clause is *undetermined*, find the first literal with unassigned variable. Then assign a truth value for the variable such that the clause satisfied.

---

The sorting is required, otherwise given formula 
$$l_1 ∧ l_2$$
we can build a worst case by adding clauses 
$$¬l_1 ∧ ¬l_2 ∧ (¬l_1∨¬l_2).$$

The greedy assignment would be $l_1=l_2=T$, then $¬l_1=¬l_2=(¬l_1∨¬l_2)=F$, thus the formula would not be $2$-approximation.

**Proof**: Since the literals and clauses are sorted in decreasing order, we can only add two of the three clauses, otherwise the clauses would remain sorted. Therefore, the solution is $2$-approximation in the worst case. 

**NOTE**: (Full proof would require generalizing the example.)

MIN SET COVER

| **Instance**: A finite set $U$ and a family $S=\{S_1,...,S_m\}$ of subset of $U.$
| **Feasible solution**: A subfamily $T⊆S$ such that their union is $U.$
| **Objective**: Minimize $c(T)=|T|.$

Greedy approximation algorithm for MIN SET COVER.

**Input**: Set samily $S$ over $U.$

**Output**: Set cover $T.$

1) Start from $T=∅$
2) Find the set $S'∈S$ that covers most uncovered elements in $U.$
3) Add $S'$ to $T.$
4) Repeat until all elements of $U$ are covered.

---

For every integer $n=2^m$ where $m∈ℕ$, there is an instance of MIN SET COVER such that 

1) There are $n$ elements in the base set.
2) The optimal cover uses two sets.
3) The greedy approximation algorithm picks $\log_2 n$ sets.

---

First we will define two functions

$$\operatorname{even}(i)=
\begin{cases}
1, & i \text{ is even} \\
0, & \text{ otherwise}\end{cases},
\quad
\operatorname{odd}(i)=
\begin{cases}
1, & i \text{ is odd} \\
0, & \text{ otherwise}\end{cases}.$$


We define the size of base set as $|U|=n.$ Then, lets partition $U$ into two equal-sized, disjoint subsets $S'$ and $S''.$ Let $T=\{S',S''\}$ be the optimal cover with two sets.

Now, we can construct the instance $S=\{S_1,...,S_m\}$ in which greedy algorithm picks all $m=\log_2 n$ sets as follows.

We begin with $K_0'=S',K_0''=S''$ and $T_0'=∅,T_0''=∅.$ For all $i=1,...,m-2$ we have

1) $K_i'=K_{i-1}'∖T_{i-1}',\quad T_i'⊆K_i',\quad |T_i'|=|S'|/2^i+\operatorname{even}(i)$
2) $K_i''=K_{i-1}''∖T_{i-1}'',\quad T_i''⊆K_i'',\quad |T_i''|=|S''|/2^i+\operatorname{odd}(i)$
3) $S_i=T_i'∪T_i''$

Finally, we define $S_{m-1}=S'$ and $S_{m}=S''.$

\pagebreak

The idea of the construction is that the set $S_i=T_i'∪T_i''$ for $i=1,...,m-2$ contains alternatingly half and half plus one of the elements that sets $S'$ or $S''$ would cover if chosen. 

Thus $S_i$ always contains one more element that either set $S'$ or $S''$ could cover, therefore greedy algorithm will always choose it.
